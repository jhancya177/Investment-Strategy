In order to generate a list of recommended stocks, we applied the RSI metric to each stock.\n","\n","The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.\n","\n","\n","The recommendation model will use two years of historical data of each stock to calculate the RSI indicator, and it will recommend a list of low RSI stocks which means they meet a condition where an asset has traded lower at price and has the potential for a price bounce.  \n","\n","Besides, the recommendation model can also recommend a list of stocks based on the stock volume, it will generate a list of high-volume stocks for recommendations if the users choose recommendations based on the volume option."],"metadata":{"id":"UhFSBlEVFvTU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install yfinance"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Amdex_7_EeJ-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651439825644,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":11284,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"1795f864-4382-4030-cc02-4bee9405317a"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting yfinance\n","  Downloading yfinance-0.1.70-py2.py3-none-any.whl (26 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas>=0.24.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yfinance) (1.3.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: multitasking>=0.0.7 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yfinance) (0.0.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.15 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from yfinance) (1.21.6)\n","Collecting lxml>=4.5.1\n","  Downloading lxml-4.8.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.manylinux_2_24_x86_64.whl (6.4 MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 6.4 MB 7.7 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hCollecting requests>=2.26\n","  Downloading requests-2.27.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (63 kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 63 kB 1.0 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas>=0.24.0->yfinance) (2022.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas>=0.24.0->yfinance) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7.3->pandas>=0.24.0->yfinance) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.26->yfinance) (1.24.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer~=2.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.26->yfinance) (2.0.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.26->yfinance) (2.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests>=2.26->yfinance) (2021.10.8)\n","Installing collected packages: requests, lxml, yfinance\n","  Attempting uninstall: requests\n","    Found existing installation: requests 2.23.0\n","    Uninstalling requests-2.23.0:\n","      Successfully uninstalled requests-2.23.0\n","  Attempting uninstall: lxml\n","    Found existing installation: lxml 4.2.6\n","    Uninstalling lxml-4.2.6:\n","      Successfully uninstalled lxml-4.2.6\n","\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
