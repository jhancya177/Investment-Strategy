Your return on investment, or what you get back in relation to what you put in, depends on the success or failure of that company. If the company does well and makes money from the products or services it sells, you expect to benefit from that success. There are two main ways to make money with stocks: Dividends. When publicly owned companies are profitable, they can choose to distribute some of those earnings to shareholders by paying a dividend. You can either take the dividends in cash or reinvest them to purchase more shares in the company. Many retired investors focus on stocks that generate regular dividend income to replace income they no longer receive from their jobs. Stocks that pay a higher than average dividend are sometimes referred to as \"income stocks.\" Capital gains. Stocks are bought and sold constantly throughout each trading day, and their prices change all the time. When a stock price goes higher than what you paid to buy it, you can sell your shares at a profit. These profits are known as capital gains. In contrast, if you sell your stock for a lower price than you paid to buy it, you\\'ve incurred a capital loss. Both dividends and capital gains depend on the fortunes of the company—dividends as a result of the company\\'s earnings and capital gains based on investor demand for the stock. Demand normally reflects the prospects for the company\\'s future performance. Strong demand—the result of many investors wanting to buy a particular stock—tends to result in an increase in the stock\\'s share price. On the other hand, if the company isn\\'t profitable or if investors are selling rather than buying its stock, your shares may be worth less than you paid for them. The performance of an individual stock is also affected by what\\'s happening in the stock market in general, which is in turn affected by the economy as a whole. For example, if interest rates go up and you think you can make more money with bonds than you can with stock, you might sell off stock and use that money to buy bonds. If many investors feel the same way, the stock market as a whole is likely to drop in value, which in turn may affect the value of the investments you hold. Other factors, such as political uncertainty at home or abroad, energy or weather problems, or soaring corporate profits, also influence market performance. However—and this is an important element of investing—at a certain point, stock prices will be low enough to attract investors again. If you and others begin to buy, stock prices tend to rise, offering the potential for making a profit. That expectation may breathe new life into the stock market as more people invest. This cyclical pattern—specifically, the pattern of strength and weakness in the stock market and the majority of stocks that trade in the stock market—recurs continually, though the schedule isn\\'t predictable. Sometimes, the market moves from strength to weakness and back to strength in only a few months. Other times, this movement, which is known as a full market cycle, takes years. At the same time that the stock market is experiencing ups and downs, the bond market is fluctuating as well. That\\'s why asset allocation, or including different types of investments in your portfolio, is such an important strategy: In many cases, the bond market is up when the stock market is down and vice versa. Your goal as an investor is to be invested in several categories of investments at the same time, so that some of your money will be in the category that\\'s doing well at any given time.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_basic_summary = summarize(stock_basic_text, word_count=150)\n","stock_basic_summary = clear_text(stock_basic_summary)\n","stock_basic_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"l3HF0o9B6vZ7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237561342,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":188,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"8ab33c7f-f679-45cd-e34c-bf1b0db28b9d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"When a stock price goes higher than what you paid to buy it, you can sell your shares at a profit.

All publicly traded companies issue common stock. Some companies also issue preferred stock, which exposes you to somewhat less risk of losing money, but also provides less potential for total return. Your total return includes any income you receive from an investment plus any change in its value. If you hold common stock you're in a position to share in the company's success or feel the lack of it. The share price rises and falls all the time—sometimes by just a few cents and sometimes by several dollars—reflecting investor demand and the state of the markets. There are no price ceilings, so it's possible for shares to double or triple or more over time—though they could also lose value. The issuing company may pay dividends, but it isn't required to do so. If it does, the amount of the dividend isn't guaranteed, and it could be cut or eliminated altogether—though companies may be reluctant to do either if they believe it will send a bad message about the company's financial health. Holders of preferred stock, on the other hand, are usually guaranteed a dividend payment and their dividends are always paid out before dividends on common stock. So if you're investing mostly for income—in this case, dividends—preferred stock may be attractive. But, unlike common stock dividends, which may increase if the company's profit rises, preferred dividends are fixed. In addition, the price of preferred stock doesn't move as much as common stock prices. This means that while preferred stock doesn't lose much value even during a downturn in the stock market, it doesn't increase much either, even if the price of the common stock soars. So if you're looking for capital gains, owning preferred stock may limit your potential profit. Another point of difference between common stock and preferred stock has to do with what happens if the company fails. In that event, there's a priority list for a company's obligations, and obligations to preferred stockholders must be met before those to common stockholders. On the other hand, preferred stockholders are lower on the list of investors to be reimbursed than bondholders are.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_types_summary = summarize(stock_types_text, word_count=150)\n","stock_types_summary = clear_text(stock_types_summary)\n","stock_types_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237562588,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"0ad06252-8c6d-4741-cee8-1992dfa064d5","id":"beFt8loc_CtF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"All publicly traded companies issue common stock.

Are they in demand and of high quality? Is the industry as a whole doing well? How has the company performed in the past? Are talented, experienced managers in charge? Are operating costs low or too high? Is the company in heavy debt? What are the obstacles and challenges the company faces? Is the stock worth the current price? Because each company is a different size and has issued a different number of shares, you need a way to compare the value of different stocks. A common and quick way to do this is to look at the stock's earnings. All publicly traded companies report earnings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis in an unaudited filing known as the 10-Q, and annually in an audited filing known as the 10-K. If you check those reports, the company's annual report, or its Web site, you'll find its current earnings-per-share, or EPS. That ratio is calculated by dividing the company's total earnings by the number of shares. You can then use this per-share number to compare the results of companies of different sizes. EPS is one indication of a company's current strength. You can divide the current price of a stock by its EPS to get the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E multiple, the most commonly quoted measure of stock value. In a nutshell, P/E tells you how much investors are paying for a dollar of a company's earnings. For example, if Company A has a P/E of 25, and Company B has a P/E of 20, investors are paying more for each dollar earned by Company A than for each dollar earned by Company B. There's no perfect P/E, though there is a market average at any given time. Over the long term that number has been about 15, though higher in some periods and lower in others. Value investors tend look for stocks with relatively low P/E ratios—below the current average—while growth investors often buy stocks with higher than average P/E ratios. While P/E can be a revealing indicator, it shouldn't be your only measure for evaluating a stock. For example, there are times you might consider a stock with a P/E that's higher than average for its industry if you have reason to be optimistic about its future prospects. Remember, though, that when a stock has an unusually high P/E, the company will have to generate substantially higher earnings in the future to make it worth the price. At the other end of the scale, a low P/E may be a sign that significant price appreciation is possible or that a company is in serious financial trouble. That's one of the determinations you'll want to make before you buy. A P/E ratio can only be as useful as the earnings numbers it's based on. While there are standards for reporting earnings, and a company's financial reports are audited, there may still be a lack of consistency across earnings reports. You've probably seen stories in the financial press about companies restating earnings. This happens when an accounting error or other discrepancy comes to light, and a company must reissue reports for past periods. Inaccurate or inconsistent earnings statements may make P/E a less reliable measure of stock value. Even though P/E is the most widely quoted measure of stock value, it's not the only one. You'll also see stock analysts discussing measures such as ROA (return on assets), ROE (return on equity), and so on. While all of these acronyms may seem confusing at first, you may find, as you get to know them, that they can help answer some of your questions about a company, such as how efficient it is, how much debt it's carrying, and so on. One way to learn more about individual stocks is through professional stock research. The brokerage firm where you have your account may provide research from its own analysts and perhaps from outside sources. You can also find independent research from analysts who aren't affiliated with a brokerage firm, as well as consensus reports that bring together opinions from a variety of analysts. Some of this research is free, while other research comes with a price tag. In the past, there have been conflicts of interest at brokerage firms that provide investment banking services to public companies, since analysts may sometimes have felt pressure to review those stocks positively. However, brokerage firms are required to establish strict separations between their investment banking and stock analysis departments to comply with regulations designed to minimize any such potential conflicts of interests.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_eva_summary = summarize(stock_eva_text, word_count=150)\n","stock_eva_summary = clear_text(stock_eva_summary)\n","stock_eva_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237564061,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":274,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"e1bb7bd5-9e9f-465e-b23f-2f5c7080e766","id":"uh_P9BvC-Yzs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Because each company is a different size and has issued a different number of shares, you need a way to compare the value of different stocks.

The kind of firm you use will determine how you convey your orders, what types of services you have access to, and what fees you pay to trade your stocks. In general, the more services the firm offers, the more you'll pay for each transaction. Brokerage firms may also charge fees to maintain your account. Full-service brokerage firms provide research as well as trade executions and may offer customized portfolio management, investment advice, financial planning, banking privileges, and other services. Discount firms offer fewer services but, as their name implies, generally charge less to execute the orders you place. The trick is to find the balance that's right for you. On the one hand, you don't want fees to cut into your returns, but on the other hand, you may benefit from more guidance. You'll want to check what effect the amount you have to invest—or what are known as your investable assets—will have on the level of service you receive and the prices you pay. You can place buy and sell orders over the phone with your broker or you can trade stocks online. Many firms offer full account access and trading through their Web sites at lower prices than they charge for phone orders. If you do trade online, it's important to be wary of trading too much, simply because it's so easy to place the trade. You should consider your decisions carefully, taking into account the fees and taxes as well as the impact on the balance of assets in your portfolio, before you place an order. There are ways to buy stock directly through certain companies without using a broker. For example, if you used a broker to purchase a share of stock in a company that offers a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, you can choose to buy additional shares through that plan. DRIPs allow you to automatically reinvest your dividends and periodically write checks to buy more stock. Some companies also offer direct purchase plans, or DPPs, that allow you to buy shares directly from the issuer at any time. DRIPs and DPPs are usually administered for the company by a third party known as a shareholder services company or stock transfer agent that can also handle the sale of your shares.

This can result in two quite different approaches to equity investing. One approach is described as \"trading.\" Trading involves following the short-term price fluctuations of different stocks closely and then trying to buy low and sell high. Traders usually decide ahead of time the percentage increase they\\'re looking for before you sell (or decrease before they buy). While trading has tremendous potential for immediate rewards, it also involves a fair share of risk because a stock may not recover from a downswing within the time frame you\\'d like—and may in fact drop further in price. In addition, frequent trading can be expensive, since every time you buy and sell, you may pay broker\\'s fees for the transaction. Also, if you sell a stock that you haven\\'t held for a year or more, any profits you make are taxed at the same rate as your regular income, not at your lower tax rate for long-term capital gains. Be aware that trading should not be confused with \"day trading,\" which is the rapid buying and selling of stock to capitalize on small price changes. Day trading can be extremely risky, especially if you attempt to day trade using borrowed money. Individual investors frequently lose money by trying to use this approach. A very different investing strategy—called buy-and-hold—involves keeping an investment over an extended period, anticipating that the price will rise over time. While buy-and-hold reduces the money you pay in transaction fees and short-term capital gains taxes, it requires patience and careful decision-making. As a buy-and-hold investor, you generally choose stocks based on a company\\'s long-term business prospects. Increases in the stock price over years tend to be based less on the volatile nature of the market\\'s changing demands and more on what\\'s known as the company\\'s fundamentals, such as its earnings and sales, the expertise and vision of its management, the fortunes of its industry, and its position in that industry. Buy-and-hold investors still need to take price fluctuations into account, and they must pay attention to the stock\\'s ongoing performance. Naturally, the price at which you buy a stock directly affects the potential profits you\\'ll make from its sale. So it makes sense to buy the stock at a price you believe is reasonable. While you hold the stock, it\\'s also important to watch for signs that your investment isn\\'t going the direction you planned—for example, if the company regularly misses its earnings targets, or if developments in the industry turn bleaker. Sometimes you\\'ll decide, after reviewing the company\\'s fundamentals, that it\\'s worthwhile to ride out a slump in price and wait for a stock to recover. Other times, you may decide you\\'ll have better returns if you sell your holding and invest elsewhere. Either way, it\\'s important to stay on top of the stocks you own by paying attention to news that could affect their value.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_trade_summary = summarize(stock_trade_text, word_count=150)\n","stock_trade_summary = clear_text(stock_trade_summary)\n","stock_trade_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237564660,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"292f70b8-a666-475e-cd64-6b03b0150024","id":"bgp8Ti3rBs0W"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'One approach is described as \"trading.\" Trading involves following the short-term price fluctuations of different stocks closely and then trying to buy low and sell high.

One reason to do this is that a very high stock price can intimidate investors who fear there is little room for growth, or what is known as price appreciation. Here's how a stock split works: Suppose a stock trading at $150 a share is split 3-for-1. If you owned 100 shares worth $15,000 before the split, you would hold 300 shares valued at $50 each after the split, so that your investment would still be worth $15,000. More investors may become interested in the stock at the lower price, so there's always the possibility that your newly split shares will rise again in price due to increased demand. In fact, it may move back toward the pre-split price—though, of course, there's no guarantee that it will. You may also own stock that goes through a reverse split, though this type of split is less common especially among seasoned companies that trade on one of the major U.S. stock markets. In this case, a company with very low-priced stock reduces the total number of shares to increase the per-share price. For example, in a reverse split you might receive one new share for every five old shares. If the price-per-share had been $1, each new share would be worth $5. Companies may do reverse splits to maintain their listing on a stock market that has a minimum per-share price, or to appeal to certain institutional investors who may not buy stock priced below a certain amount. In either of those cases—indeed if reverse splits are announced or actually occur—you'll want to proceed with caution. Reverse splits tend to go hand in hand with low priced, high risk stocks.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stock_split_summary = summarize(stock_split_text, word_count=150)\n","stock_split_summary = clear_text(stock_split_summary)\n","stock_split_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237567570,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"c7de7206-1a0c-4b1c-8d79-b11bcf2b47c7","id":"vOJeLVwSDty9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"When a stock price gets very high, companies may decide to split the stock to bring its price down.

When you buy shares of a fund you become a part owner of the fund. This is true of bond funds as well as stock funds, which means there is an important distinction between owning an individual bond and owning a fund that owns the bond. When you buy a bond, you are promised a specific rate of interest and return of your principal. That's not the case with a bond fund, which owns a number of bonds with different rates and maturities. What your equity ownership of the fund provides is the right to a share of what the fund collects in interest, realizes in capital gains, and receives back if it holds a bond to maturity. If you own shares in a mutual fund you share in its profits. For example, when the fund's underlying stocks or bonds pay income from dividends or interest, the fund pays those profits, after expenses, to its shareholders in payments known as income distributions. Also, when the fund has capital gains from selling investments in its portfolio at a profit, it passes on those after-expense profits to shareholders as capital gains distributions. You generally have the option of receiving these distributions in cash or having them automatically reinvested in the fund to increase the number of shares you own. Of course, you have to pay taxes on the fund's income distributions, and usually on its capital gains, if you own the fund in a taxable account. When you invest in a mutual fund you may have short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income — something you may try to avoid when you sell your individual securities. You may also owe capital gains taxes if the fund sells some investments for more than it paid to buy them, even if the overall return on the fund is down for the year or if you became an investor of the fund after the fund bought those investments in question. However, if you own the mutual fund in a tax-deferred or tax-free account, such as an individual retirement account, no tax is due on any of these distributions when you receive them. But you will owe tax at your regular rate on all withdrawals from a tax-deferred account. You may also make money from your fund shares by selling them back to the fund, or redeeming them, if the underlying investments in the fund have increased in value since the time you purchased shares in the funds. In that case, your profit will be the increase in the fund's per-share value, also known as its net asset value or NAV. Here, too, taxes are due the year you realize gains in a taxable account, but not in a tax-deferred or tax-free account. Capital gains for mutual funds are calculated somewhat differently than gains for individual investments, and the fund will let you know each year your taxable share of the fund's gains.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["htw_summary = summarize(htw_text, word_count=150)\n","htw_summary = clear_text(htw_summary)\n","htw_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237568279,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"e6ba44c5-bae0-497c-cd25-093c4bce5dc9","id":"8ABtfTxgVsyy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"What your equity ownership of the fund provides is the right to a share of what the fund collects in interest, realizes in capital gains, and receives back if it holds a bond to maturity.

Funds create new shares to meet demand for increased sales and buy back shares from investors who want to sell. Sometimes, open-end funds get so large that they are closed to new investors. Even if an open-end fund is closed, however, it still remains an open-end fund since existing shareholders can continue to buy and sell fund shares. Open-end funds calculate the value of one share, known as the net asset value (NAV), only once a day, when the investment markets close. All purchase and sales for the day are recorded at that NAV. To figure its NAV, a fund adds up the total value of its investment holdings, subtracts the fund's fees and expenses, and divides that amount by the number of fund shares that investors are currently holding. NAV isn't necessarily a measure of a fund's success, as stock prices are, however. Since open-end funds can issue new shares and buy back old ones all the time, the number of shares and the dollars invested in the fund are constantly changing. That's why in comparing two funds it makes more sense to look at their total return over time rather than to compare their NAVs. Closed-end funds differ from open-end funds because they raise money only once in a single offering, much the way a stock issue raises money for the company only once, at its initial public offering, or IPO. After the shares are sold, the closed-end fund uses the money to buy a portfolio of underlying investments, and any further growth in the size of the fund depends on the return on its investments, not new investment dollars. The fund is then listed on an exchange, the way an individual stock is, and shares trade throughout the day. You buy or sell shares of a closed-end fund by placing the order with your stockbroker.

In fact, one reason you might choose a specific fund is to benefit from the expertise of its professional managers. A successful fund manager has the experience, the knowledge, and the time to seek and track investments — key attributes that you may lack. The goal of an active fund manager is to beat the market — to get better returns by choosing investments he or she believes to be top-performing selections. While there is a range of ways to measure market performance, each fund is measured against the appropriate market index, or benchmark, based on its stated investment strategy and the types of investments it makes. For instance, many large-cap stock funds typically use the Standard & Poor's 500 Index as the benchmark for their performance. A fund that invests in stocks across market capitalizations might use the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Total Stock Market Index, which despite its name measures more than 5,000 stocks, including small-, mid-, and large-company stocks. Other indexes that track only stocks issued by companies of a certain size, or that follow stocks in a particular industry, are the benchmarks for mutual funds investing in those segments of the market. Similarly, bond funds measure their performance against a standard, such as the yield from the 10-year Treasury bond, or against a broad bond index that tracks the yields of many bonds. One of the challenges that portfolio managers face in providing stronger-than-benchmark returns is that their funds' performance needs to compensate for their operating costs. The returns of actively managed funds are reduced first by the cost of hiring a professional fund manager and second by the cost of buying and selling investments in the fund. Suppose, for example, that the management and administrative fees of an actively managed fund are 1.5 percent of the fund's total assets and the fund's benchmark provided a 9 percent return. To beat that benchmark, the portfolio manager would need to assemble a fund portfolio that returned better than 10.5 percent before fees were taken out. Anything less, and the fund's returns would lag its benchmark. In any given year, most actively managed funds do not beat the market. In fact, studies show that very few actively managed funds provide stronger-than-benchmark returns over long periods of time, including those with impressive short term performance records. That's why many individuals invest in funds that don't try to beat the market at all. These are passively managed funds, otherwise known as index funds. Passive funds seek to replicate the performance of their benchmarks instead of outperforming them. For instance, the manager of an index fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 typically buys a portfolio that includes all of the stocks in that index in the same proportions as they are represented in the index. If the S&P 500 were to drop a company from the list, the fund would sell it, and if the S&P 500 were to add a company, the fund would buy it. Because index funds don't need to retain active professional managers, and because their holdings aren't as frequently traded, they normally have lower operating costs than actively managed funds. However, the fees vary from index fund to index fund, which means the return on these funds varies as well. Some index funds, which go by names such as enhanced index funds, are hybrids. Their managers pick and choose among the investments tracked by the benchmark index in order to provide a superior return. In bad years, this hybrid approach may produce positive returns, or returns that are slightly better than the overall index. Of course, it's always possible that this type of hybrid fund will not do as well as the overall index. In addition, the fees for these enhanced funds may be higher than the average for index funds.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ap_summary = summarize(ap_text, word_count=150)\n","ap_summary = clear_text(ap_summary)\n","ap_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237568909,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":145,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"f02a0769-406c-446d-eb3e-b61e59ebc141","id":"Em3YlUC8WgXq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"The goal of an active fund manager is to beat the market — to get better returns by choosing investments he or she believes to be top-performing selections.

Here is just a sampling of the many you'll find: Stock funds: Growth funds\\xa0invest in stocks that the fund's portfolio manager believes have potential for significant price appreciation. Value funds\\xa0invest in stocks that the fund's portfolio manager believes are underpriced in the secondary market. Equity income funds\\xa0invest in stocks that regularly pay dividends. Stock index funds\\xa0are passively managed funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a specific stock market index by investing in the stocks held by that index. Small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap stock funds\\xa0stick to companies within a certain size range. Economic cycles tend to favor different sized companies at different times, so, for example, a small-cap fund may be doing very well at a time when large-cap funds are stagnant, and vice versa. Socially responsible funds\\xa0invest according to political, social, religious, or ethical guidelines, which you'll find described in the fund's prospectus. Many socially responsible funds also take an activist role in the companies where they invest by representing their shareholders' ethical concerns at meetings with company management. Sector funds\\xa0specialize in stocks of particular segments of the economy. For example, you may find funds that specialize solely in technology stocks, in healthcare stocks, and so on. Sector funds tend to be less diversified than funds that invest across sectors, but they do provide a way to participate in a profitable segment of the economy without having to identify specific companies. International, global, regional, country-specific, or emerging markets funds\\xa0extend their reach beyond the United States. International funds invest exclusively in non-U.S. companies. Global funds may invest in stocks of companies all over the world, including U.S. companies with global businesses. Regional funds focus on stocks of companies in a particular region, such as Europe, Asia, or Latin America, while country-specific funds narrow their range to stocks from a single country. Funds that invest in emerging markets look for stocks in developing countries. Bond funds: Corporate, agency, or municipal bond funds\\xa0focus on bonds from a single type of issuer, across a range of different maturities. Short-term or intermediate-term bond funds\\xa0focus on short- or intermediate-term bonds from a wide variety of issuers. Treasury bond funds\\xa0invest in Treasury issues. High-yield bond funds\\xa0invest in lower-rated bonds with higher coupon rates. Other funds: Balanced funds\\xa0invest in a mixture of stocks and bonds to build a portfolio diversified across both asset classes. The target percentages for each type of investment are stated in the prospectus. Because stocks and bonds tend to do well during different phases of an economic cycle, balanced funds may be less volatile than pure stock or bond funds. Funds of funds\\xa0are mutual funds that invest in other mutual funds. While these funds can achieve much greater diversification than any single fund, their returns are affected by the fees of both the fund itself and the underlying funds. There may also be redundancy, which can cut down on diversification, since several of the underlying funds may hold the same investments. Target-date funds, sometimes called lifecycle funds, are funds of funds that change their investments over time to meet goals you plan to reach at a specific time, such as retirement. Typically, target-date funds are sold by date, such as a 2025 fund. The farther away the date is, the greater the risks the fund usually takes. As the target date approaches, the fund changes its balance of investments to emphasize conserving the value it has built up and to shift toward income-producing investments. Money market funds\\xa0invest in short-term debt, such as Treasury bills and the very short-term corporate debt known as commercial paper. These investments are considered cash equivalents. Money market funds invest with the goal of maintaining a share price of $1. They are sometimes considered an alternative to a bank savings account although they aren't insured by the FDIC. Some funds have private insurance. It's important to keep in mind that funds don't always invest 100 percent of their assets in line with the strategy implied by their stated objectives. Some funds undergo what's called style drift when the fund manager invests a portion of assets in a category that the fund would typically exclude — for example, the manager of large-company fund may invest in some mid-sized or small companies. Fund managers may make this type of adjustment to compensate for lagging performance, but it may expose you to risks you weren't prepared for. The SEC has issued rules that require a mutual fund to invest at least 80 percent of its assets in the type of investment suggested by its name. But funds can still invest up to one-fifth of their holdings in other types of securities — including securities that you might consider too risky or perhaps not aggressive enough. You might want to check the latest quarterly report showing the fund's major investment holdings to see how closely the fund manager is sticking to the strategy described in the prospectus, which is presumably why you invested in the fund.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":52}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fo_summary = summarize(fo_text, word_count=150)\n","fo_summary = clear_text(fo_summary)\n","fo_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237569242,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":181,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"43dd51ba-cd11-4769-8032-6eb9980c2e8c","id":"Kc6s17G-ZqPt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"While there are literally thousands of individual mutual funds, there are only a handful of major fund categories: Stock funds invest in stocks Bond funds invest in bonds Balanced funds invest in a combination of stocks and bonds Money market funds invest in very short-term investments and are sometimes described as cash equivalents Within the major categories of mutual funds, there are individual funds with a variety of investment objectives, or goals the fund wants to meet on behalf of its shareholders.

One of the main differences among these classes is how much you will pay in expenses and how much your broker will be paid for selling you the fund. Before deciding on a share class within a fund, it is important for you to understand the differences between them. What Are Mutual Fund Share Classes? A single mutual fund, with one investment portfolio and one investment adviser, may offer more than one \"class\" of its shares to investors. Each class represents a similar interest in the mutual fund\\'s portfolio. The mutual fund will charge you different fees and expenses depending on the class you choose. Some classes provide rights or benefits that others do not. When deciding which share class is best for you, carefully consider: How long you plan to hold the fund. The size of your investment. Whether you qualify for any sales charge discounts or other fee waivers. You can find out whether a mutual fund has different classes by looking at the prospectus. The most common share classes — A, B, C, and Transaction (or “clean”) shares — that retail investors might encounter outside a 401(k) or other retirement plan are described below. What Types of Fees and Expenses Will I Pay? All mutual funds charge fees and expenses, some of which you pay directly (like sales charges and redemption fees) and others that come out of the fund\\'s assets (to pay for such things as managing the fund’s portfolio, or marketing and distribution). These fees and expenses can vary widely from fund to fund or fund class to fund class. Even small differences in expenses can make a big difference in your return over time. When choosing among different mutual fund share classes, be aware that your investment professional might receive higher (or lower) commissions or payments from the sale of one share class relative to another. You can use FINRA’s Fund Analyzer to see the impact of these fees over time on your account value — and to assess which share class might be best for you, given your goals, investment amount, and expected holding period. Here are the most common differences among shares of mutual funds: Class A Shares Class A shares typically impose a front-end sales charge, which means a portion of your dollars is not invested, and is instead paid in part to the brokerage firm selling you the fund. Let’s say you spend $1,000 to purchase Class A shares, and the fund imposes a front-end sales charge of 5 percent. You pay the $50 (5% of $1,000) up front and receive shares with a market value of $950. Class A shares may impose an asset-based sales charge (often 0.25 percent per year), but it generally is lower than the charge imposed by the other classes (often 1 percent per year for Class B and C shares). Depending on the size of your purchase, the mutual fund might offer you discounts, called breakpoints, on the front-end sales charge. For example, a fund may charge a smaller percentage front-end sales charge (4.5 percent instead of 5 percent if you invest at least $50,000 in the fund. There are different ways you can qualify for a sales charge breakpoint. Often you can qualify for a breakpoint in your sales charge if you: Make a large purchase. Already have investments in the same fund or other mutual funds offered by the same fund family, which count toward the investment amount needed to get a breakpoint (Rights of Accumulation). Have family members (or others with whom you may link according to fund rules) who have invested in the same fund family. Commit to regularly purchasing the mutual fund\\'s shares over a specified time period with a Letter of Intent (LOI). Another way to invest in Class A shares without paying a front-end sales charge is by exchanging your investment in one fund for an investment in another fund in the same fund family. For example, let’s say you redeem (sell) $25,000 of your Class A Shares of the ABC Growth Fund and invest the proceeds in Class A Shares of the ABC International Fund. Since you already paid a sales charge when you invested in the Growth Fund, you won’t be charged a new sales charge for your $25,000 investment in the International Fund. Always ask your investment professional whether any breakpoint discounts or sales charge waivers are available to you. Class A shares also charge management fees and 12b-1 fees. Management fees are the same for all share classes of any fund, but different funds often have different management fees. However, 12b-1 fees for Class A shares are generally lower than the 12b-1 fees for class B and C shares. Because of lower 12b-1 fees, total operating expenses on class A shares, over time, are generally lower, too. Class B Shares Class B shares typically do not charge a front-end sales charge when you buy shares, but they normally impose what’s called a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) if you sell your shares within a certain period, often six years. Sometimes called a back-end load, the CDSC normally declines the longer your hold your shares and, eventually, is eliminated. Within two years after the CDSC is eliminated, Class B shares often \"convert\" into lower-cost Class A shares. When they convert, they begin to charge the same fees as Class A shares. Because Class B shares do not impose a sales charge at the time of purchase, all of your dollars are immediately invested — unlike Class A shares. But your annual expenses, as measured by the expense ratio, may be higher. You also may pay a sales commission when you sell your Class B shares. B shares generally impose a 12b-1 fee that is higher than what you would incur if you purchased class A shares. If you intend to purchase a large amount of Class B shares (over $50,000 or $100,000, for example), you may want to discuss with your investment professional whether Class A shares would be preferable. The expense ratio charged on Class A shares is generally lower than for Class B or C shares. The mutual fund also may offer large-purchase breakpoint discounts from the front-end sales charge for Class A shares. Most mutual funds no longer offer Class B shares, so they may not be an option for you. Class C Shares Class C shares do not impose a front-end sales charge on the purchase, so the full dollar amount that you pay is invested. Often Class C shares impose a small charge (often 1 percent) if you sell your shares within a short time, usually one year. They typically impose higher asset-based sales charges than Class A shares. Unlike B shares, they typically do not convert to class A shares and, instead, continue to charge higher annual expenses (including 12b-1 fees) for as long as the shares are held. Like class B shares, C shares typically impose higher annual operating expenses than class A shares due, primarily, to higher 12b-1 fees. Class C shares may be less expensive than class A or B shares if you have a shorter-term investment horizon because you will pay little or no sales charge. However, your annual expenses could be higher than class A shares, and even class B shares, if you hold your shares for a long time. Transaction (“Clean”) Shares \"Transaction Shares\" is a term that applies to a class of fund shares without any front-end load, deferred sales charge, 12b-1 fees, or other asset-based fee for sales or distribution. Even though Transaction Shares do not impose any sales charges, in some cases, a brokerage firm may separately require you to pay a sales commission when you invest in these shares. If your trades generate a commission, work with your financial professional to estimate your trading frequency (also called annual turnover) for the fund. This frequency may be related to how often you rebalance, reallocate, or redeploy assets in your portfolio. Also, if you invest in Transaction Shares through an investment advisory account, normally you will pay the investment adviser a fee equal to a percentage of your assets in the account for providing ongoing advice to you.\\xa0 There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to these shares, so you should talk to your financial professional about what rights and benefits you are eligible for. It is also important to know that with Transaction Shares, some brokerage firms may not offer sales charge breakpoint discounts or waivers that would be available if you invested in Class A Shares, such as through rights of accumulation, letters of intent, and exchanging shares of one fund for shares of another fund in the same family. FINRA Fund Analyzer One of the best ways to evaluate a fund, compare share classes, and especially to compare costs and fees, is to use FINRA’s Fund Analyzer. The Fund Analyzer helps both investors and financial professionals understand the impact of fees and potential available discounts on mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and money market funds. The Fund Analyzer allows you to sort through and compare more than 30,000 products and calculates how a fund\\'s fees, expenses and discounts impact the value of a fund over time. With a focus on the impact of fund fees and expenses as well as account-based fees, you can better determine which funds might best meet your investing needs at the lowest cost while providing the best value.\\xa0See our overview of the Fund Analyzer and the different comparisons that can be modeled in the tool.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":56}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sc_summary = summarize(sc_text, word_count=150)\n","sc_summary = clear_text(sc_summary)\n","sc_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237569685,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":282,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"f37d90eb-6f7e-4a6a-f513-98d512dcfc91","id":"x5FXNGxuaFDN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'When choosing among different mutual fund share classes, be aware that your investment professional might receive higher (or lower) commissions or payments from the sale of one share class relative to another.

Because small percentage differences can add up to a big dollar difference in the returns on your mutual funds, it\\'s important to be aware of all the fees associated with any fund you invest in. Some fees are charged at specific times, based on actions you take, and some are charged on an ongoing basis. Fees are described in detail in each fund\\'s prospectus, which you should be sure to read before investing in any fund. Here are types of fees that may be charged on an ongoing basis: Management fees. These fees pay the fund\\'s portfolio manager. 12b-1 fees. These fees, capped at 1 percent of your assets in the fund, are taken out of the fund\\'s assets to pay for the cost of marketing and selling the fund, for some shareholder services, and sometimes to pay employee bonuses. Other expenses. This miscellaneous category includes the costs of providing services to shareholders outside of the expenses covered by 12b-1 fees or portfolio management fees. You also pay transaction fees for the trades the fund makes, though this amount is not reported separately as the other fees are. The following fees are based on actions you may take, so may or may not be amounts you pay: Account fees. Funds may charge you a separate fee to maintain your account, especially if your investment falls below a set dollar amount. Redemption fees. To discourage very short-term trading, funds often charge a redemption fee to investors who sell shares shortly after buying them. Redemption fees may be charged anywhere from a few days to over a year. So it\\'s important to understand if and how your fund assesses redemption fees before you buy, especially if you think you might need to sell your shares shortly after purchasing them. Exchange fees. Some funds also charge exchange fees for moving your money from one fund to another fund offered by the same investment company. Purchase fees. Whether or not a fund charges a front-end sales charge, it may assess a purchase fee at the time you buy shares of the fund. One easy way to compare mutual funds fees is to look for a number called the fund\\'s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses, otherwise known as the fund\\'s expense ratio. This percentage, which you can find in a fund\\'s prospectus, on the fund\\'s website, or in financial publications, will tell you the percentage of the fund\\'s total assets that goes toward paying its recurring fees every year. The higher the fund\\'s fees, the greater its handicap in terms of doing better than the overall market as measured by the appropriate benchmark. For example, if you were considering two similar funds, Fund ABC and Fund XYZ, you might want to look at their expense ratios. Suppose Fund ABC had an expense ratio of 0.75 percent of assets, while Fund XYZ had an expense ratio of 1.85 percent. For Fund XYZ to match Fund ABC in annual returns, it would need a portfolio that outperformed Fund ABC by more than a full percentage point. Remember, though, that the expense ratio does not include loads, which are fees you may pay when you buy or sell your fund. FINRA provides an easy-to-use, online Fund Analyzer that allows you to compare expenses among funds — or among different share classes of the same fund. Using a live data feed that captures expense information for thousands of funds, the analyzer can help you understand the impact fees have on your investment over time. Once you select up to three funds, type in the amount you plan to invest and how long you plan to keep the fund, the analyzer does the rest. You should also be aware of transaction fees, which the mutual fund pays to a brokerage firm to execute its buy and sell orders. Those fees are not included in the expense ratio, but are subtracted before the fund\\'s return is calculated. The more the fund buys and sells in its portfolio, which is reported as its turnover rate, the higher its transaction costs may be. Understanding Loads When you buy mutual fund shares from a stockbroker or other investment professional, you might have to pay sales charges, called loads, which are calculated as a percentage of the amount you invest. Like commissions on stock or bond transactions, these charges compensate the broker for the time and effort of working with you to select an appropriate investment. Here are four terms to know: 1. Front-end load: a commission you pay at the time you buy the shares, which can range between 2 percent and 5 percent 2. Back-end load: a charge you pay only if you sell your shares during the period the charge applies, which can be several years after purchase 3. Level load: an amount the fund collects every year you hold the fund 4. No-load: funds that don’t impose sales charges but might have other fees (you typically buy no-load shares directly from the investment company that offers these funds) \\xa0 The rate at which you\\'re charged varies from fund company to fund company. In addition, companies may offer different classes of shares, which assess the charge at different times. You\\'ll want to be sure you understand the financial consequences of choosing a specific share class before you purchase a fund. You can use FINRA\\'s Fund Analyzer to compare share classes. Breakpoints Sometimes load funds offer volume discounts for higher investment amounts, in much the way that supermarkets sometimes offer economy bargains for buying certain things in bulk. In the case of funds, a front-end load may be reduced if you invest a certain amount. The amounts at which your sales charges drop are called breakpoints. The breakpoints are different for each fund, and your broker must tell you what they are and must apply breakpoints if your investment qualifies. Breakpoint rules vary, but some funds let you qualify for breakpoints if all your investments within the same fund family — funds offered by the same fund company — add up to the breakpoint level. Some funds let the total investments made by all the members of your household count toward the breakpoint. In addition, some funds let you qualify for a breakpoint over time, instead of with a single investment, by adding your past investments to your new ones. You might even qualify for a breakpoint if you write a letter of intent, informing the fund that you\\'re planning to invest enough to qualify for the breakpoint in the future. In short, funds can offer breakpoints any number of ways, or they may not offer them at all. Whenever you\\'re entitled to breakpoints, however, the fund is required to apply them to your investment. To find out whether a fund offers breakpoints, use FINRA\\'s Fund Analyzer. Sales Charge Waivers To maximize your investment, be sure to understand and explore any potential sales charge waivers.\\xa0Here are five to be aware of:  1. Mutual Fund Exchanges Mutual funds typically allow investors to sell shares in one fund and purchase shares in another fund in the same fund family on the same date without incurring sales charges. 2. Rights of Reinstatement A fund family may allow customers to redeem or sell shares in a fund and reinvest some or all of the proceeds without paying a sales charge or recoup some or all of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). Generally, in order to be eligible for this type of waiver: The reinvestment must be made within a specified period of time (e.g., 90 days, although time periods may vary substantially across fund families); The redemption and reinvestment must take place in the same account; The redeemed shares must have been subject to a front-end or deferred sales charge; and The redemption and reinvestment must comply with any other terms and conditions required by certain investment companies (e.g., reinvestments must be made in the share class of the redeemed fund). 3. NAV Transfers Some fund families allow customers to purchase class A shares without paying the front-end sales charge if the customer purchases such shares using proceeds from the sale of shares in a different mutual fund family for which the investor paid a front-end or back-end sales charge; these transactions are sometimes referred to as \"NAV transfers.\"\\xa0Most fund families that allow for such waivers require the customer to invest the proceeds from the sale within 30 to 90 days. 4. Waivers for Retirement Accounts and Charities Some fund families waive the front-end sales charges associated with Class A shares for certain retirement plans and charitable organizations. 5. Waivers for 529 Plans 529 plans offer sales charge waivers in a variety of specific situations, such as: Existing account owners currently investing in charge-waived A shares; Group 529 plans; Plans purchased through an investment adviser; Certain customers approved for discount by the program manager or broker-dealer; Rollovers from qualified 529 plans; or Special share classes.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":60}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fe_summary = summarize(fe_text, word_count=150)\n","fe_summary = clear_text(fe_summary)\n","fe_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237570195,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":291,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"afad38d1-6e35-4f96-9b2e-39885538398d","id":"ScXfg2llakJd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"To discourage very short-term trading, funds often charge a redemption fee to investors who sell shares shortly after buying them.

A bond is a loan that an investor makes to a corporation, government, federal agency or other organization. Consequently, bonds are sometimes referred to as debt securities. Since bond issuers know you aren\\'t going to lend your hard-earned money without compensation, the issuer of the bond (the borrower) enters into a legal agreement to pay you (the bondholder) interest. The bond issuer also agrees to repay you the original sum loaned at the bond\\'s maturity date, though certain conditions, such as a bond being called, may cause repayment to be made earlier. The vast majority of bonds have a set maturity date—a specific date when the bond must be paid back at its face value, called par value. Bonds are called fixed-income securities because many pay you interest based on a regular, predetermined interest rate—also called a coupon rate—that is set when the bond is issued. Similarly, the term “bond market” is often used interchangeably with \"fixed-income market.\" Bond Maturity A bond\\'s term, or years to maturity, is usually set when it is issued. Bond maturities can range from one day to 100 years, but the majority of bond maturities range from one to 30 years. Bonds are often referred to as being short-, medium- or long-term. Generally, a bond that matures in one to three years is referred to as a short-term bond. Medium- or intermediate-term bonds are generally those that mature in four to 10 years, and long-term bonds are those with maturities greater than 10 years. The borrower fulfills its debt obligation typically when the bond reaches its maturity date, and the final interest payment and the original sum you loaned (the principal) are paid to you. Callable Bonds Not all bonds reach maturity, even if you want them to. Callable bonds are common. They allow the issuer to retire a bond before it matures. Call provisions are outlined in the bond\\'s prospectus (or offering statement or circular) and the indenture—both are documents that explain a bond\\'s terms and conditions. While firms are not formally required to document all call provision terms on the customer\\'s confirmation statement, many do so. When you buy municipal securities, firms are required to provide more call information on the customer confirmation than you will see for other types of debt securities. You usually receive some call protection for a period of the bond\\'s life (for example, the first three years after the bond is issued). This means that the bond cannot be called before a specified date. After that, the bond\\'s issuer can redeem that bond on the predetermined call date, or a bond may be continuously callable, meaning the issuer may redeem the bond at the specified price at any time during the call period. Before you buy a bond, always check to see if the bond has a call provision, and consider how that might impact your investment strategy. Bond Coupons A bond\\'s coupon is the annual interest rate paid on the issuer\\'s borrowed money, generally paid out semiannually. The coupon is always tied to a bond\\'s face or par value, and is quoted as a percentage of par. For instance, a bond with a par value of $1,000 and an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent has a coupon rate of 4.5 percent ($45). Many bond investors rely on a bond\\'s coupon as a source of income, spending the simple interest they receive. You can also reinvest the interest, letting your interest gain interest. If the interest rate at which you reinvest your coupons is higher or lower, your total return will be more or less. Also be aware that taxes can reduce your total return. The Power of Compounding Regardless of the type of investment you select, saving regularly and reinvesting your interest income can turn even modest amounts of money into sizable investments through the remarkable power of compounding. If you save $200 a month and receive a 5 percent annual rate of return, you will have more than $82,000 in 20 years\\' time.  Accrued Interest Accrued interest is the interest that adds up (accrues) each day between coupon payments. If you sell a bond before it matures or buy a bond in the secondary market, you most likely will catch the bond between coupon payment dates. If you\\'re selling, you\\'re entitled to the price of the bond, plus the accrued interest that the bond has earned up to the sale date. The buyer compensates you for this portion of the coupon interest, which is generally handled by adding the amount to the contract price of the bond. Use our Accrued Interest Calculator to figure out a bond\\'s accrued interest. Bond Prices Bonds are generally issued in multiples of $1,000, also known as a bond\\'s face or par value. But a bond\\'s price is subject to market forces and often fluctuates above or below par. If you sell a bond before it matures, you may not receive the full principal amount of the bond and will not receive any remaining interest payments. This is because a bond\\'s price is not based on the par value of the bond. Instead, the bond\\'s price is established in the secondary market and fluctuates. As a result, the price may be more or less than the amount of principal and the remaining interest the issuer would be required to pay you if you held the bond to maturity. The price of a bond can be above or below its par value for many reasons, including: interest rate adjustments to the bond; whether a bond credit rating has changed; supply and demand; a change in the creditworthiness of a bond\\'s issuer; whether the bond has been called or is likely to be (or not to be) called; or, a change in the prevailing market interest rates. If a bond trades above par, it is said to trade at a premium. If a bond trades below par, it is said to trade at a discount. For example, if the bond you desire to purchase has a fixed interest rate of 8 percent, and similar-quality new bonds available for sale have a fixed interest rate of 5 percent, you will likely pay more than the par amount of the bond that you intend to purchase, because you will receive more interest income than the current interest rate (5 percent) being attached to similar bonds.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":67}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["bbasic_summary = summarize(bbasic_text, word_count=150)\n","bbasic_summary = clear_text(bbasic_summary)\n","bbasic_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"FBRnVkRYn-sq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648237746517,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":129,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"2f322c22-f961-4a20-8b1f-7f8214273a3e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'The vast majority of bonds have a set maturity date—a specific date when the bond must be paid back at its face value, called par value.

When interest rates fall—bond prices generally rise. Every bond carries interest rate risk. Interest rate changes are among the most significant factors affecting bond return. To find out why, we need to start with the bond\\'s coupon. This is the interest the bond pays out. How does that original coupon rate get established? One of the key determinants is the federal funds rate, which is the prevailing interest rate that banks with excess reserves at a Federal Reserve district bank charge other banks that need overnight loans. The Fed sets a target for the federal funds rate and maintains that target interest rate by buying and selling U.S. Treasury securities. When the Fed buys securities, bank reserves rise, and the federal funds rate tends to fall. When the Fed sells securities, bank reserves fall, and the federal funds rate tends to rise. While the Fed doesn\\'t directly control this rate, it effectively controls it through the buying and selling of securities. The federal funds rate, in turn, influences interest rates throughout the country, including bond coupon rates. Another rate that heavily influences a bond\\'s coupon is the Fed’s Discount Rate, which is the rate at which member banks may borrow short-term funds from a Federal Reserve Bank. The Fed directly controls this rate. Say the Fed raises the discount rate by one-half of a percent. The next time the U.S. Treasury holds an auction for new Treasury bonds, it will quite likely price its securities to reflect the higher interest rate. What happens to the Treasury bonds you bought a couple of months ago at the lower interest rate? They\\'re not as attractive. If you want to sell them, you\\'ll need to discount their price to a level that equals the coupon of all the new bonds just issued at the higher rate. In short, you\\'d have to sell your bonds at a discount. It works the other way, too. Say you bought a $1,000 bond with a 6 percent coupon a few years ago and decided to sell it three years later to pay for a trip to visit your ailing grandfather, except now, interest rates are at 4 percent. This bond is now quite attractive compared to other bonds out there, and you would be able to sell it at a premium. Basis Point Basics You often hear the term basis points—bps for short—in connection with bonds and interest rates. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point (.01). One percent = 100 basis points. One half of 1 percent = 50 basis points. Bond traders and brokers regularly use basis points to state concise differences in bond yields. The Fed likes to use bps when referring to changes in the federal funds rate. Where to Find Economic Indicators Smart bond investors pay close attention to key or \"leading\" economic indicators, primarily watching for any potential impact they may have on inflation and, because there is a close correlation, interest rates. Various branches of the federal government keep tabs on many, but not all, of these leading indicators. Here are a few useful online resources: U.S. Census Bureau\\'s Economic Briefing Room and Economic Calendar U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics The Conference Board\\'s Economic Indicators The Fed\\'s calendar of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.

There are several definitions that are important to understand when talking about yield as it relates to bonds: coupon yield, current yield, yield-to-maturity, yield-to-call and yield-to-worst. Let's start with the basic yield concepts. Coupon yield is the annual interest rate established when the bond is issued. It's the same as the coupon rate and is the amount of income you collect on a bond, expressed as a percentage of your original investment. If you buy a bond for $1,000 and receive $45 in annual interest payments, your coupon yield is 4.5 percent. This amount is figured as a percentage of the bond's par value and will not change during the lifespan of the bond Current yield is the bond's coupon yield divided by its market price. Here's the math on a bond with a coupon yield of 4.5 percent trading at 103 ($1,030).  Say you check the bond's price later, and it's trading at 101 ($1,010). The current yield has changed:  If you buy a new bond at par and hold it to maturity, your current yield when the bond matures will be the same as the coupon yield. Yields That Matter More Coupon and current yield only take you so far down the path of estimating the return your bond will deliver. For one, they don't measure the value of reinvested interest. They also aren't much help if your bond is called early—or if you want to evaluate the lowest yield you can receive from your bond. In these cases, you need to do some more advanced yield calculations. Fortunately, there is a spate of financial calculators available—some that even estimate yield on a before- and after-tax basis. The following yields are worth knowing, and should be at your broker's fingertips: Yield to maturity (YTM) is the overall interest rate earned by an investor who buys a bond at the market price and holds it until maturity. Mathematically, it is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows (from coupons and principal repayment) equals the price of the bond. YTM is often quoted in terms of an annual rate and may differ from the bond’s coupon rate. It assumes that coupon and principal payments are made on time. It does not require dividends to be reinvested, but computations of YTM generally make that assumption. Further, it does not consider taxes paid by the investor or brokerage costs associated with the purchase. Yield to call (YTC) is figured the same way as YTM, except instead of plugging in the number of months until a bond matures, you use a call date and the bond's call price. This calculation takes into account the impact on a bond's yield if it is called prior to maturity and should be performed using the first date on which the issuer could call the bond. Yield to worst (YTW) is whichever of a bond's YTM and YTC is lower. If you want to know the most conservative potential return a bond can give you—and you should know it for every callable security—then perform this comparison. Yield reflecting broker compensation is the yield adjusted by the amount of the mark-up or commission (when you purchase) or mark-down or commission (when you sell) and other fees or charges that you are charged by your broker for its services. Three Assumptions YTM and YTC are based on the following assumptions: You hold your bond to maturity or call date. You reinvest every coupon. All coupons are reinvested at the YTM or YTC, whichever is applicable.  Interest rates regularly fluctuate, making each reinvestment at the same rate virtually impossible. Thus, YTM and YTC are estimates only, and should be treated as such. While helpful, it's important to realize that YTM and YTC may not be the same as a bond's total return. Such a figure is only accurately computed when you sell a bond or when it matures. Bond Fact Price and yield are inversely related: As the price of a bond goes up, its yield goes down, and vice versa. Reading a Yield Curve You've probably seen financial commentators talk about the Treasury Yield Curve when discussing bonds and interest rates. It's a handy tool because it provides, in one simple graph, the key Treasury bond data points for a given trading day, with interest rates running up the vertical axis and maturity running along the horizontal axis. A typical yield curve is upward sloping, meaning that securities with longer holding periods carry higher yield.  In the yield curve above, interest rates (and also the yield) increase as the maturity or holding period increases—yield on a 30-day T-bill is 2.55 percent, compared to 4.80 percent for a 20-year Treasury bond—but not by much. When an upward-sloping yield curve is relatively flat, it means the difference between an investor’s return from a short-term bond and the return from a long-term bond is minimal. Investors would want to weigh the risk of holding a bond for a long period (see Interest Rate Risk) versus the only moderately higher interest rate increase they would receive compared to a shorter-term bond. Indeed, yield curves can be flatter or steeper depending on economic conditions and what the Federal Reserve Board (or the “Fed”) is doing, or what investors expect the Fed to do, with the money supply. Sometimes economic conditions and expectations create a yield curve with different characteristics. For instance, an inverted yield curve slopes downward instead of up. When this happens, short-term bonds pay more than long-term bonds. Yield curve watchers generally read this as a sign that interest rates may decline. The Department of Treasury provides daily Treasury Yield Curve rates, which can be used to plot the yield curve for that day. Figuring Bond Return If you've held a bond over a long period of time, you might want to calculate its annual percent return, or the percent return divided by the number of years you've held the investment. For instance, a $1,000 bond held over three years with a $145 return has a 14.5 percent return, but a 4.83 percent annual return. When you calculate your return, you should account for annual inflation. Calculating your real rate of return will give you an idea of the buying power your earnings will have in a given year. You can determine real return by subtracting the inflation rate from your percent return. As an example, an investment with 5 percent return during a year of 2 percent inflation is usually said to have a real return of 3 percent. To figure total return, start with the value of the bond at maturity (or when you sold it) and add all of your coupon earnings and compounded interest. Subtract from this figure any taxes and any fees or commissions. Then subtract from this amount your original investment amount. This will give you the total amount of your total gain or loss on your bond investment. To figure the return as a percent, divide that number by the beginning value of your investment and multiply by 100:\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":90}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["bond_yield_summary = summarize(bond_yield_text, word_count=150)\n","bond_yield_summary = clear_text(bond_yield_summary)\n","bond_yield_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648240266931,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"3af276d6-5094-4a29-da7b-7f5ee6b9e919","id":"B45EfdVKxZKi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"The following yields are worth knowing, and should be at your broker's fingertips: Yield to maturity (YTM) is the overall interest rate earned by an investor who buys a bond at the market price and holds it until maturity.

Some bonds are easier to buy and sell than others—but that doesn\\'t stop investors from buying and selling all kinds of bonds virtually every second of every trading day. The way you buy and sell bonds often depends on the type bond you select. Treasury and savings bonds may be bought and sold through an account at a brokerage firm, or by dealing directly with the U.S. government. New issues of Treasury bills, notes and bonds—including TIPS—can be bought through a brokerage firm, or directly from the government through auctions at the U.S. Treasury Department\\'s TreasuryDirect website. Savings bonds can also be purchased from the government, or through banks, brokerages and many workplace payroll deduction programs. Corporate and municipal bonds may be purchased, like stock, through\\xa0full-service, discount or online brokers, as well as through investment and commercial banks. Once new-issue bonds have been priced and sold, they begin trading on the secondary market, where buying and selling is also handled by a broker. You will generally pay brokerage fees when buying or selling corporates and munis through a brokerage firm. Buying anything but Treasuries and savings bonds typically requires using a broker. You can buy virtually any type of bond or bond fund through a brokerage firm. Some firms specialize in buying and selling a specific type of bond, such as municipal bonds.\\xa0 In bond transactions, your firm can act as an \"agent\" or \"principal.\"\\xa0 If the firm acts as agent in a bond transaction with you where you want to buy a bond—it seeks out bonds from sellers for you. If you are selling, the firm will search the market for potential buyers. When the firm acts as principal, which is the case for most bond transactions, it sells you a bond that the firm already owns, sometimes referred to as selling the bond from inventory, or buys the bond from you for its own inventory. When the firm is acting as principal, the broker\\'s compensation typically is in the form of a mark-up or mark-down.\\xa0 The firm\\'s mark-up or mark-down is included in the price you pay for the bond. You will want to pay close attention to the costs, fees and broker compensation you are charged in any bond transaction.\\xa0 Taxes As with buying and selling stocks, there are tax consequences associated with buying and selling bonds because of the income or gains you accrue with your bond investments. Whether or not you will need to pay taxes on a bond\\'s interest income (coupons) or a bond fund\\'s dividends depends on the entity that issued the bond. Corporate and Mortgaged-Backed Bonds—The interest you get from corporate and mortgage backed bonds typically is subject to federal and state income tax. Treasuries and Other Federal Government Bonds—The interest you earn on Treasuries and agency bonds backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government is subject to federal income tax, but not state income tax. This does not include bonds in which the U.S. government only provides a guarantee such as with Ginnie Maes. Municipal Bonds—Municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal income tax. If the municipal bond was issued by your state or local government, the interest on the bond is usually exempt from state and local taxes, as well. However, if the bond was issued by a state or local government outside of the state in which you reside, the interest from the bond is usually subject to state income tax. Bonds issued by a U.S. Territory, such as Puerto Rico or Guam, however, are exempt from federal, state and local taxes in all 50 states. As of January 1, 2013, the tax code imposes a Net Investment Income Tax of 3.8 percent on investors who meet certain income thresholds and other criteria. To learn more about the tax, who it applies to and how you calculate net investment income, be sure to talk with your tax professional or read the IRS\\'s Net Investment Income Tax FAQs. Capital Gains When you purchase an individual bond at face value and hold it to maturity, there is no capital gain to be taxed. Of course, if you sell the bond for a profit before it matures, you\\'ll likely generate a taxable gain, even if it\\'s a tax-exempt bond. If you owned the bond for more than a year, your gain is taxed at the long-term capital gain rate. If you owned the bond for one year or less, you are taxed at the short-term rate. With a bond fund, you are unlikely to sell at the exact share price at which you bought, which means you incur a capital gain or loss. In addition, mutual fund managers buy and sell securities all year long, incurring capital gains and losses. If the gains are more than the losses, shareholders will receive a capital gain disbursement at the end of the year. Remember: the tax rules that apply to bonds are complicated. Before investing, you may want to check with your tax advisor about the tax consequences of investing in individual bonds or bond funds.

Here are some common risk factors to be aware of with respect to bond and bond fund investments. Interest Rate Risk Remember the cardinal rule of bonds: When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates (in the U.S. or other world markets) may reduce (or increase) the market value of a bond you hold. Interest rate risk—also referred to as market risk—increases the longer you hold a bond. Let\\'s look at the risks inherent in rising interest rates. Say you bought a 10-year, $1,000 bond today at a coupon rate of 4 percent, and interest rates rise to 6 percent. If\\xa0you need to sell your 4 percent bond prior to maturity you must compete with newer bonds carrying higher coupon rates. These higher coupon rate bonds decrease the appetite for older bonds that pay lower interest. This decreased demand depresses the price of older bonds in the secondary market, which would translate into you receiving a lower price for your bond if you need to sell it. In fact, you may have to sell your bond for less than you paid for it. This is why interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk. Rising interest rates also make new bonds more attractive (because they earn a higher coupon rate). This results in what\\'s known as opportunity risk—the risk that a better opportunity will come around that you may be unable to act upon. The longer the term of your bond, the greater the chance that a more attractive investment opportunity will become available, or that any number of other factors may occur that negatively impact your investment. This also is referred to as holding-period risk—the risk that not only a better opportunity might be missed, but that something may happen during the time you hold a bond to negatively affect your investment. Bond fund managers face the same risks as individual bondholders. When interest rates rise—especially when they go up sharply in a short period of time—the value of the fund\\'s existing bonds drops, which can put a drag on overall fund performance. Call Risk Similar to when a homeowner seeks to refinance a mortgage at a lower rate to save money when loan rates decline, a bond issuer often calls a bond when interest rates drop, allowing the issuer to sell new bonds paying lower interest rates—thus saving the issuer money. For this reason, a bond is often called following interest rate declines. The bond\\'s principal is repaid early, but the investor is left unable to find a similar bond with as attractive a yield. This is known as call risk. With a callable bond, you might not receive the bond\\'s original coupon rate for the entire term of the bond, and it might be difficult or impossible to find an equivalent investment paying rates as high as the original rate. This is known as reinvestment risk. Additionally, once the call date has been reached, the stream of a callable bond\\'s interest payments is uncertain, and any appreciation in the market value of the bond may not rise above the call price. Duration Risk If you own bonds or have money in a bond fund, there is a number you should know. It is called duration. Although stated in years, duration is not simply a measure of time. Instead, duration signals how much the price of your bond investment is likely to fluctuate when there is an up or down movement in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive your bond investment will be to changes in interest rates. Duration risk is the name economists give to the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a one percent change in interest rates. Refunding Risk and Sinking Funds Provisions A sinking fund provision, which often is a feature included in bonds issued by industrial and utility companies, requires a bond issuer to retire a certain number of bonds periodically. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including through purchases in the secondary market or forced purchases directly from bondholders at a predetermined price, referred to as refunding risk. Holders of bonds subject to sinking funds should understand that they risk having their bonds retired prior to maturity, which raises reinvestment risk. Default and Credit Risk If you have ever loaned money to someone, chances are you gave some thought to the likelihood of being repaid. Some loans are riskier than others. The same is true when you invest in bonds. You are taking a risk that the issuer\\'s promise to repay principal and pay interest on the agreed upon dates and terms will be upheld. While U.S. Treasury securities are generally deemed to be free of default risk, most bonds face a possibility of default. This means that the bond obligor will either be late paying creditors (including you, as a bondholder), pay a negotiated reduced amount or, in worst-case scenarios, be unable to pay at all. Using Ratings Agencies to Assess Default & Credit Risk The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has designated 10 rating agencies as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). These organizations review information about selected issuers, especially financial information, such as the issuer\\'s financial statements, and assign a rating to an issuer\\'s bonds—from AAA (or Aaa) to D (or no rating). Each NRSRO uses its own ratings definitions and employs its own criteria for rating a given security. It is entirely possible for the same bond to receive a rating that differs, sometimes substantially, from one NRSRO to the next. While it is a good idea to compare a bond\\'s rating across the various NRSROs, not all bonds are rated by every agency, and some bonds are not rated at all. In such cases, you may find it difficult to assess the overall creditworthiness of the issuer of the bond. Slow Down When You See \"High Yield\" Generally, bonds are lumped into two broad categories—investment grade and non-investment grade. Bonds that are rated BBB, bbb, Baa or higher are generally considered investment grade. Bonds that are rated BB, bb, Ba or lower are non-investment grade. Non-investment grade bonds are also referred to as high-yield or junk bonds. Junk bonds typically offer a higher yield than investment-grade bonds, but the higher yield comes with increased risk—specifically, the risk that the bond’s issuer may default. Don\\'t Reach Investors who decide which bonds to buy based solely on a bond\\'s yield are \"reaching for yield,\" one of the most common mistakes bond investors make.\\xa0See FINRA’s Investor Alert The Grass Isn’t Always Greener—Chasing Return in a Challenging Investment Environment. Inflation and Liquidity Risk Inflation risk is the risk that the yield on a bond will not keep pace with purchasing power (in fact, another name for inflation risk is purchasing power risk). For instance, if you buy a five-year bond in which you can realize a coupon rate of 5 percent, but the rate of inflation is 8 percent, the purchasing power of your bond interest has declined. All bonds but those that adjust for inflation, such as TIPS, expose you to some degree of inflation risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that you will not be easily able to find a buyer for a bond you need to sell. A sign of liquidity, or lack of it, is the general level of trading activity: A bond that is traded frequently in a given trading day is considerably more liquid than one which only shows trading activity a few times a week. Some bonds, like U.S. Treasury securities, are quite easy to sell because there are many people interested in buying and selling such securities at any given time. These securities are liquid. Others trade much less frequently. Some even turn out to be \"no bid\" bonds, with no buying interest at all. These securities are illiquid. Investors can check corporate bond trading activity—and thus liquidity—by using FINRA\\'s Market Data Center. For insight into municipal bond liquidity, investors can use trade data found on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\\'s website. Event Risk Mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and major corporate restructurings are all events that put corporate bonds at risk, thus the name event risk. Other events can also trigger changes in a company\\'s financial health and prospects, which may trigger a change in a bond\\'s rating. These include a federal investigation of possible wrongdoing, the sudden death of a company\\'s chief executive officer or other key manager, or a product recall. Energy prices, foreign investor demand and world events also are triggers for event risk. Event risk is extremely hard to anticipate and may have a dramatic and negative impact on bondholders.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":98}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["bond_risk_summary = summarize(bond_risk_text, word_count=150)\n","bond_risk_summary = clear_text(bond_risk_summary)\n","bond_risk_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648240427724,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":133,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"95010e7b-e370-4104-8359-d819fca1f7c7","id":"esox607KyD5L"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"This also is referred to as holding-period risk—the risk that not only a better opportunity might be missed, but that something may happen during the time you hold a bond to negatively affect your investment.

While there are important distinctions between them, each type of fund allows you to instantly diversify risk among a pool of bonds at a low minimum investment. Before you invest in a bond fund, it is important that you understand the different fund types and how bond funds differ from individual bonds. For instance, one common misconception about bond mutual funds is that there is no risk to principal. This is not the case: Your initial and subsequent investments will fluctuate—and indeed may decline—just as they do if invested in a stock mutual fund. Bond Mutual Funds Mutual funds have become a preferred way to invest for millions of Americans. A mutual fund is simply a pool of money invested for you by an investment firm in a variety of instruments like stocks, bonds or government securities. Each mutual fund is different in its make-up and philosophy. A bond mutual fund is a mutual fund that invests in bonds. Bond mutual funds can contain all of one type of bond (municipal bonds, for instance) or a combination of bond types. Each bond fund is managed to achieve a stated investment objective. Like most investments, bond mutual funds charge fees and expenses that are paid by investors. These costs can vary widely from fund to fund or fund class to fund class. Because even small differences in expenses can make a big difference in your return over time, we've developed a fund analyzer to help you compare how sales loads, fees and other mutual fund expenses can impact your return. The most common type of bond mutual funds, open-end funds, are actively managed bond funds that allow you to buy or sell your share in the fund whenever you want. You buy and sell at a fund's net asset value (NAV), the value or price per individual fund share, priced at the end of each trading day—not throughout the day, as is the case with stocks. Index bond mutual funds are passively managed and are engineered to match the composition of a bond index, such as the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. Once the fund is constructed and trading, very little human intervention takes place; the fund's performance is structured to track that of the index it mirrors. Regardless of the type of bond mutual fund you select, keep these four points in mind: Return of principal is not guaranteed because of the fluctuation of the fund's NAV due to the ever-changing price of bonds in the fund, and the continual buying and selling of bonds by the fund's manager. As with direct bond ownership, bond funds have interest rate, inflation and credit risk associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. In contrast to owning individual bonds, there are ongoing fees and expenses associated with owning shares of bond funds. As with individual bonds, you pay income tax on bond interest according to your tax bracket. Closed-End Bond Funds Like bond mutual funds, closed-end bond funds are actively managed. However, a closed-end fund has a specific number of shares that are listed and traded on a stock exchange or over-the-counter market. Like stocks, shares of closed-end funds are based on their market price as determined by the forces of supply and demand in the marketplace. Shares may trade at a premium (above NAV) or, more often, at a discount (below NAV). Investors should be aware that closed-end funds may be leveraged, meaning the fund has issued or purchased stock or other investments using borrowed funds. While this leverage may result in increased yield during favorable market conditions, it could also result in losses if market conditions become unfavorable. For more information, read our Investor Alert, Closed-End Fund Distributions: Where is the Money Coming From? Exchange-Traded Bond Funds An exchange-traded bond fund (bond ETF) is similar to a mutual fund, but trades on one of the major stock markets and can be bought and sold through a brokerage account throughout the trading day, like a stock. It can track a specific bond index such as the S&P International Corporate Bond Index or be actively managed with a specific strategy in mind. Bond Unit Investment Trusts Bond UITs, as they are referred to, are made up of a fixed parcel of bonds that are held in a trust and rarely change once the initial bond purchase is fixed, making it easier to estimate how much you will earn. UITs are passively managed funds. On the trust's maturity date, the portfolio is liquidated and the proceeds are returned to unit holders in proportion to the amount invested. Unit holders who want to sell before maturity may have to accept less than they paid. While UITs are more diversified than an individual bond, they are generally far less diversified than a bond mutual fund. Each bond in the UIT has its own maturity date and often its own call provision as well, which can impact return and should be considered when estimating earnings. As each bond matures, or is called (UITs carry call risk), the principal is paid out to the shareholders until the last bond matures. The Difference between Bonds and Bond Funds Individual bonds and bond funds are two very different animals. Understanding how bond funds and individual bonds differ will help you assess which is the best investment option for you. Here are four factors you should consider: Return of Principal. Unless there is a default, when an individual bond matures or is called, your principal is returned. That is not true with bond funds. Bond funds have no obligation to return your principal. Except for UITs, they have no maturity date. With a bond fund, the value of your investment fluctuates from day to day. While this is also true of individual bonds trading in the secondary market, if the price of a bond declines below par, you always have the option of holding the bond until it matures and collecting the principal. Income. With most fixed-rate individual bonds, you know exactly how much interest you'll receive. With bond funds, the interest you receive can fluctuate with changes to the underlying bond portfolio. Another consideration is that many bond funds pay interest monthly opposed to semiannually, as is the case with most individual bonds. Diversification. With a single purchase, a bond fund provides you with instant diversification at a very low cost. To put together a diversified portfolio of individual bonds, you'll need to purchase several bonds, and that might cost you $50,000 or more. Most mutual funds only require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars. Liquidity. Virtually all bond funds can be sold easily at any time at the current fund value (NAV). The liquidity of individual bonds, on the other hand, can vary considerably depending on the bond. In addition to taking longer to sell, illiquid bonds may also be more expensive to sell. Buying and Selling Bond Funds Bond funds can be bought and sold through a broker or other investment professional, or through the fund directly. Keep in mind that if you work with a broker, the choice of bond funds is limited to those the brokerage firm allows its professionals to sell. As with other mutual funds, when you buy shares of a bond fund, you pay the fund’s current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any fee the fund or broker assesses at the time of purchase. This may include a sales load or other type of purchase fee. When you sell your shares, the fund will pay you the NAV minus any fee the fund or investment professional charges at the time of sale, such as a back-end sales load or redemption fee. Most funds have a toll-free number or Web site that can provide information about the fund and the net asset value (NAV) of a fund’s shares, as well as the ability to request or download a prospectus.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":102}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["bond_funds_summary = summarize(bond_funds_text, word_count=150)\n","bond_funds_summary = clear_text(bond_funds_summary)\n","bond_funds_summary"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648240508078,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":165,"user":{"displayName":"Jin Hui Xu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17560415295537552770"}},"outputId":"1f8b1f6d-96ac-4967-db8b-bd8857f983b5","id":"-vomZewJyWKy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"There are four types of bond funds: mutual funds, closed-end funds, unit investment trusts (UITs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

They include money market securities, asset-backed and preferred securities, as well as auction rate and event-linked securities. Money Market Securities Money market securities are often considered a good place to invest funds that are needed in a shorter time period—usually one year or less. Money market instruments include bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Bankers' acceptances are typically used to finance international transactions in goods and services, while certificates of deposit (CDs) are large-denomination, negotiable time deposits issued by commercial banks and thrift institutions. Commercial paper takes the form of short-term, unsecured promissory notes issued by both financial and non-financial corporations. Some combination of these products makes up a money market fund. All money market funds are required to have a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that cannot exceed 90 days. While money market securities are highly liquid (you can usually receive your money in a few days, compared to months or years with a CD), the interest you earn on your money tends to be quite low and may not keep pace with inflation. Asset-Backed Securities Asset-backed securities are certificates that represent an interest in a pool of assets such as credit card receivables, auto loans and leases, home equity loans, and even the future royalties of a musician (for instance, Bowie bonds). Once you get beyond mortgage-backed securities, which are a type of asset-backed security, investing and trading in the asset-backed market is almost exclusively done by more sophisticated investors; like mortgage-backed securities, there can be significant risks associated with any asset-based security. Preferred Securities There are two common types of preferred securities: equity preferred stock and debt preferred stock. Equity preferred stock is much like common stock in that it never matures, and it declares dividends rather than awarding regular interest payments. Debt preferreds pay interest like traditional bonds, and since they are corporate debt, they stand ahead of equity preferred securities in the payout hierarchy should the company default. However, many preferreds are hybrids—they contain a combination of debt and equity features, and it is not always clear which type of security they are. Unlike traditional bonds, preferreds generally have a par value of $25 instead of the traditional $1,000. They also tend to pay interest quarterly, rather than the traditional semiannual payment associated with most bonds. Most preferreds are listed just like stocks, with the majority trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Like traditional bonds, preferreds tend to have credit ratings, and upgrades and downgrades often play an important role in the price a preferred can command in the secondary market. Auction Rate Securities Auction rate securities (ARS) are often debt instruments (corporate or municipal bonds) with long-term maturities, but their interest rates can be regularly reset through Dutch auctions. For many years, investors purchased ARS seeking cash-like investments that paid a higher yield than money market mutual funds or certificates of deposit. Those expectations changed in early 2008 when credit market turbulence led many ARS auctions to fail. For more information, see FINRA’s Investor Alert, Auction Rate Securities: What Happens When Auctions Fail. Event-Linked Bonds Event-linked bonds—also called insurance-linked, or “catastrophe” bonds—are financial instruments that allow investors to speculate on a variety of events, including catastrophes such as hurricanes, earthquakes and pandemics. These products are not offered directly to individual investors. But various funds, including mutual funds and closed-end funds, have purchased or are authorized to purchase them on behalf of individual investors. While not widespread, holdings of event-linked securities in these funds—especially high income funds—are also not unusual. Event-linked securities currently offer higher interest rates than similarly rated corporate bonds. But, if a triggering catastrophic event occurs, holders can lose most or all of their principal and unpaid interest payments.

Here are three you might find useful: Bond Laddering is a strategy that uses \"maturity weighting,\" which involves dividing your money among several different bonds with increasingly longer maturities, and is frequently recommended for investors interested in using bonds to generate income. Laddering is used to minimize both interest-rate risk and reinvestment risk. If interest rates rise, you reinvest the bonds that are maturing at the bottom of your ladder in higher-yielding bonds. If rates fall, you are protected against reinvestment risk because you have longer-maturity bonds at the top of your ladder that aren\\'t exposed to the drop. Bond Swapping involves selling one bond and simultaneously purchasing another similar bond with the proceeds from the sale. Why would you engage in this practice? You may wish to take advantage of current market conditions (e.g., a change in interest rates), or perhaps a change in your own personal financial situation has now made a bond with a different tax status appealing. Bond swapping can also cause you to receive certain tax benefits. In fact, tax swapping is the most common of bond swaps. Reinvestment of Interest Income is a strategy in which you reinvest your bond interest (coupons). If you buy individual bonds, this takes discipline because you need to put each coupon payment you receive to work earning interest rather than spend it. Consider putting them in a brokerage money market account, or even opening a standard savings account just for your coupon payments. At the end of each year, you can put them into the next bond in your laddering strategy.
